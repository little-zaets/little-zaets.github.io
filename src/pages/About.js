              Greetings, my name is Rina.
              <br />
              I'm a web developer with experience in React JS, Node JS, Express JS
              and PostreSQL.
            </p>
          </Col>
        </Row>
      </Container>
      <div>
        <Content>
          <p>
            My enthusiasm for coding developed as I strived to improve my
            organizationâ€™s efficiency and processes in light of new softwares
            and tools that were constantly introduced. By leveraging the
            priceless knowledge I gained from my past experiences, I bring a
            gapless, cross-functional perspective to the development process,
            rather than the common block-scope view.
          </p>
          <p>
            I aspire to combine my operational and technical experience in order
            to enable an effective development process by bridging the gap
            between my organization's departments.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am constantly working to improve and learn new technologies, and
            welcome any challenge that comes my way.
          </p>
